# BallJump
Runs a game called "Ball Jump" (based on Doodle Jump) on an
Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display using an ESP32 microcontroller.
There are two modes in the game: (1) normal mode in which the
user controls the x-axis of the ball using a joystick and
(2) creative mode in which the user controlls the x-axis of
the ball using an Adafruit LIS3DH accelerometer.
